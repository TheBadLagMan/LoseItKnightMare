FAQ:
Q: How to use the bot?
A: Right-click a message --> Apps --> reply to create a meme from existing message.
**OR**
Use the /post command and fill in the fields with a user ping/id, memetext, and an OPTIONAL name.

Q: How to use /post?
A: "author" is the person who said the quote, their name and pfp are used. "memetext" is the text that will be printed. 
"manualauthorname" is if you want the name at the bottom to be different from the discord name of the author, this one is optional and must be typed (not pinged).

Q: Why the errors?
A: There's a cooldown to avoid spam and crashes.
A faulty command could crash the bot forcing a restart. I could also be updating the bot and/or it's offline.

Q: I don't want to ping a user when making a meme.
A: Slash commands are different from messages. Pinging a user in an interaction (slash command) will not notify the user. Same applies for the right-click menu.

Q: Why does the bot think I'm the meme author?
A: You have to paste a user id, or ping a user in the author field. If the bot can't fetch a user, it defaults to you.

Q: How to get user ids?
A: In Discord go to User Settings --> App Settings --> Advanced --> Developer Mode --> ON
You can now copy user ids from the right click menu. Using Discord's autofill for pings is more efficient however.
**IDS ONLY WORK IF YOU SHARE A SERVER WITH THE USER!**

Q: Why does the text look weird?
A: I tried my best with centering, shrinking, and creating newlines. This is so messages of all sizes can fit. The @ and # signs are removed from mentions for a cleaner result.
**Bigger messages will take longer!**

Q: What about emojis?
A: Some default emojis will work, not custom ones.

Q: Can you add more features/I have another question that isn't answered?
